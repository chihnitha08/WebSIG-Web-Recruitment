##LEVEL-2-HTML

#What html does?
- Forms the basic structure of every website.
-  tells browsers how to display text, images, links, and other media using tags and elements like headings (<h1>), 
paragraphs (<p>), and links (<a>). 
- It's the fundamental building block of the web, defining the meaning and organization of content.

#Difference between div and semantic tags
- div is a non semantic tag, while semantic tags describe the maening or type of content they contain
- semantic tags help search engines understand the content structure.
- semantic tags mages the code more readable.

#What confused you the most?
- why semantic tags dont stick footer at bottom incase if we write it above , they are acting similar to div, and all semantic tags are acting similar though they have
 different names and describe different content.
